# Work In Progress
  This is a work in progress of an (express)[https://github.com/visionmedia/express/] like web .. thing .. for Go. Mostly a "Danny wants to play with Go". Use it at your own risk, if it ever becomes something pretty I'll let you know, Brian (I really hope your name is Brian).

# What it does currently
  * Allows you to add routes
  * Mount servers to a path
  * Allow you to add middleware
  * Probably breaks

# Stuff
The commander-express.go has some kind of example of how to use this. It's what I'm running to see I haven't broken anything.

# Testing
Ok, some tests were added so it's not so HAHA worthy. But they're really basic and probably lacking coverage.
